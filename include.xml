	On Android, this extension is not treated as a dependency.
	We want to refer to lime/sdl, which is in the "app" module
	of the created gradle project. But you can't have circular
	dependencies. So instead, the files in this extension are
	bundled straight into the "app" module.

	This means that any special configuration we would want in
	the build.gradle file will have to be placed in the main
	build.gradle file for the app.

	To clean this up, lime would need to have a "lime" module
	that "app" depends on. Then we could depend on "lime" here,
	and "app" could depend on us.
